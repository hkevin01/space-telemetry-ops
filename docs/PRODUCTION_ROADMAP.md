# 🚀 Space Telemetry Operations - Production Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the strategic development path to achieve **production-ready status** for the Space Telemetry Operations platform. The focus is on core telemetry processing capabilities, enterprise features, and market differentiation while avoiding scope creep risks.

## ✅ Strategic Decision: Core Platform Focus

**Decision**: Focus exclusively on standard telemetry ingestion protocols rather than specialized spacecraft buses.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ **Zero scope creep risk** - no complex RF protocols or specialized hardware
- ✅ **Faster time to market** - leveraging proven technologies
- ✅ **Market reality alignment** - most missions use protocol converters already
- ✅ **Resource optimization** - all effort focused on high-value core features
